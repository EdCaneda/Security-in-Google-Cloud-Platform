Signed URLs provide a great way to give time-limited read or write access to anyone in possession of the URL, regardless of whether they have a Google account. 
Using a policy document for an HTML form post requires the following. First, correct a policy document for your form ensuring it is UTF-8 encoded. Second, encode the policy document as a base64 representation. Third, sign your policy document using RSA with SHA-256 encoding using the secret key provided to you in the Google Cloud platform console. This step will then create a message digest. Four next, we want to encode the message digest as a base64 representation and five add the policy document information to the HTML form.

Lab: Utilize CSEK to encrypt files in cloud storage. Rotate encryption keys.
Lab: manage keys and encrypted data using Cloud key management storage or KMS, create key rings and crypto keys, set a default encryption key for Storage bucket, encrypt an object with a Cloud KMS key, rotate encryption keys, manually perform server-side encryption with KMS keys.

Tables, rows, and columns are channeled resources of datasets meaning they inherit permissions from their parent dataset. It is not possible to grant permissions at the table, row or column level. All tables in a dataset share the same permissions. 
what if I want admins or super users to see all the data in a table and others to only see a subset of the data? The answer to this is authorized views. Views provide row or column level permissions to datasets. To create authorized views, create a second data set with different permissions from the first. Add a view to the second dataset that selects the subset of the data you want to expose from the first dataset. In the first dataset, you then have to give the view access to the underlying data. 
Lab: set permissions on BigQuery data sets, use authorized views to provide audiences read-only access to subsets of tables, and use the current user function to limit access to specified rows within a table/view.
