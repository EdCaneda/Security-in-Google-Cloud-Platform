can control individual ingress and egress traffic for compute resources using firewall rules. Since VPC networks can be global in GCP, firewall rules are also global.
2 default implied rules: The first rule permits all outgoing connections to any IP address. The second implied rule blocks all incoming traffic. 
There are a few firewall rule best practices to help secure instances running in compute engine. First, keep your firewall rule in line with the model of least privilege. Create rules to explicitly allow only the traffic necessary for your applications to communicate. Second, it is always best to minimize direct exposure to the internet. To do this, avoid having allow firewall rules defined within the source or destination range set to 0.0.0.0/0. Third, to prevent port and protocols from being exposed accidentally, create a firewall rule with the lowest priority that blocks all outbound traffic for all protocols and ports. This rule will override the implied egress rules that allows all outbound traffic, and instead lock down your computer engine instance from making connections. You should then create higher priority firewall rules to specify computer engine instances to open required ports and protocols. This helps prevent ports and protocols from being exposed unnecessarily. 
Another best practice is to adopt a standard naming convention for firewall rules. The exact format is not critically important, so just create a standard and be consistent. 
When applying firewall rules, you should consider using service account firewall rules instead of tag-based rules. The reason for this is that tag-based firewall rules can be applied by any user who has compute engine instance admin role, but a service account requires a user to have explicit cloud IM rights to be used.
