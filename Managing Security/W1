Google designs custom integrated circuits including a hardware security chip called Titan, that's currently being deployed on both servers and peripherals. This approach enables Google server machines to use cryptographic signatures to ensure they only boot with the correct software. 
Google's infrastructure provides cryptographic privacy and integrity for remote procedure call data on the network. This protocol is how Google services communicate with each other and allows the infrastructure to automatically encrypt RPC traffic in transit between data centers. To help ensure that code is as secure as possible, Google stores its source code centrally and requires two part review of any new code.
Google also provides its developers with sophisticated libraries that keep them from introducing new classes of security bugs. Additionally, Google also runs a bug bounty program in which anyone who was able to discover and inform us of bugs in our infrastructure or applications is paid a reward. 
Google services that wants to make themselves available on the Internet, register themselves with an infrastructure service called the Google Front End, GFE. GFE checks incoming network connections for correct certificates and best practices. It also supports strong encryption and amps protection against denial of service attacks. The sheer scale of its infrastructure enables Google to absorb challenging attacks such as denial of service or DoS. Behind the GFEs, Google has a multi-tear multi-layer denial of service protection that further reduce the risk of any DoS impact.
