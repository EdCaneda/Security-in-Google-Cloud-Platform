When you migrate to Cloud Identity, you must verify that you own the domain name and you create an account for each of your users. You can then manage all users from the Google Admin console. The admin console provides a central management location or a single plane of glass to manage your user's identity and access permissions across your entire domain.
Consumer accounts such as personal Gmail accounts or consumer accounts with work email IDs are unmanaged accounts and are outside of the GCP Admin control. This can be a security issue if developers in your organization use unmanaged accounts to use GCP resources. To resolve this problem, you can create free Cloud Identity accounts separate from the G Suite accounts to manage these users. You can then manage all of your users across the entire domain from one place by simply assigning roles to users and groups through the GCP Console, IAM and Admin section.
