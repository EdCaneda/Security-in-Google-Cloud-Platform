A distributed-denial-of-service or DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic from multiple sources. 
attackers build networks of infected computers known as botnets by spreading malicious software through emails, websites, or social media. Once infected, these machines can be controlled remotely without the owner's knowledge, and they are used like an army to launch an attack against any target. Some botnets are actually millions of machines strong. 
[For context, a huge attack in 2017 had the strength of around one terabit per second. For reference, the whole Internet has a bisection bandwidth of 200 terabits per second. Now, when you compare this to a single Google data center, which has a bisection bandwidth of 1300 terabits per second, you can see we have an internal capacity, many times that of the traffic load, we anticipate. This means that when there is an attack, we have time to isolate it and address it.]
