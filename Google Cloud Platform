GCP Services: compute, storage, big data and machine learning.

Cloud computing 5 traits-
on-demand self-service (no human intervention needed to get resources)
broad network access 
resource pooling (provider shares resources to customers)
rapid elasticity (get more resources quickly as needed)
measured service (pay only for what u consumed)

colocation brought us cloud computing [physical/colo -> virtualization -> serverless (automatic)]
cloud computing service let you scale your resource use up and down.
false: To get resources from a cloud computing provider, is working with a person at the provider required.
virtualised data centers: IaaS [infrastructure as a service] and PaaS [platform as a service]
IaaS provide raw compute storage and networks
PaaS bind application to libraries that give access to the infrastructure that application needs.
